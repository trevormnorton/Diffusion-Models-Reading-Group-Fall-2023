# Diffusion-Models-Reading-Group-Fall-2023

This repository will hold the papers, notes, and other materials for the diffusion models reading group in Fall 2023.

## About the reading group

This reading group will meet weekly in 3120B Torgersen Hall every Thursday from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. The focus is to learn and discuss diffusion models with particular interest in their application of the inference/prediction/design of biomolecules. We will read (approximatley) one paper per week and take turns starting giving short presentations. Presentations will be 30-45 minutes long and will go over the details and results of the paper. We will then use the remaining time to ask questions and have imformal discussions.
